            Dear babi, <br><br>
            Hi, Babi. It's been already 200 days that we have been a couple. 
            I've told you many times that I appreciate for waiting for me while I am in the military even though we are in a long distance relationship.
            Everyone knows how hard it is and you are doing it so well. 
            <br><br>
            Before I met you, I had no idea what I want to do in my future. I had no plans, hopes and happiness in the future until I met you. 
            You changed my life by coming into my life and brought hopes, happiness and plans for OUR futures. You have no idea how much that means to me.
            I guess true love is inexhaustible. The more I give, the more I have. That is the reason why I do not want to lose on I love you more fights &hearts;
            <br><br>
            Even we have never met for 200 days, we love each other so much that no one can tear us apart. Even we are in long distance relationship, 
            our love langauges are physical touch. Only have 1 month left until we meet in vancouver babyyyy~~~. 
            <br>
            I really love you the most, and I care about you more than anything. Also click the button for the last present.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br><br>
            Your bobo, JunHyun Park
